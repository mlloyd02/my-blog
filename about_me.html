      Gritty, soulful and always danceable, Union Shakedown has been described as a combination of Tom Waits and Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings. The four piece’s singular brand of alt-soul and energetic stage show have been refined over ten years of playing music together.  Extravagant front man Pork Potato is backed up by a tight funk and R&B rhythm section, blistering tenor sax and very sexy Rhodes Piano.

      Union Shakedown began in 2003 on the campus of Hamline University as a hip-hop/blues experiment. After graduation, they began focussing on creating original music inspired by the 60s soul, 70s funk, early blues and classic rock. They cut their teeth with residencies at Big V’s in St. Paul, and Whiskey Junction and the Fine Line Music Cafe in Minneapolis.

      In 2010 Union Shakedown teamed up with engineer Chad Weis (Bad Plus, Mason Jennings) to produce their debut, self titled EP. In the years that followed, they’ve been known as the houseband for the Lovely Creatures Cabaret at Ground Zero Nightclub, and for performing their unique soul music at dozens of venues across the Twin Cities. Look for their new record, scheduled to be released in March 2015.
